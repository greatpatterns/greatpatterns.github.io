- <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sh43kd1ytb" target="_blank">Squeeze Theorem</a>: This shows how $$f(x) = x^2\cos\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$$ is trapped between the two curves $$y = x^2$$ and $$y = -x^2$$ near $$x = 0$$.
- <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/w89j6rob2z" target="_blank">Infinite Limits of $1/x$</a>: This shows the behavior of the reciprocal function $$y = \frac{1}{x}$$ near $$0$$.
- <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yqszno4ff1" target="_blank">Secant Lines and Tangent Line</a>: This shows how the secant lines approach the tangent line at a given point on the function $$y = \cos x$$.
- <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tsudsmikbl" target="_blank">$e$ satisfying a limit</a>: The exponential function $$y = b^{x}$$ and its derivative are plotted with a slider. Moving the slider will allow us to find $$b$$ such that the graph of the function is exactly the same as its derivative.
- <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nyvcqnpvbn" target="_blank">Limit of $sin(x)/x$</a>: This is being used to prove $$\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$$.
- <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bbhjedqwzw" target="_blank">Linearization of $\ln(x)$ at $1$</a>: This shows the error between the actual function value of $$\ln x$$ and its linearization at $$1$$.
- <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/obgnocobjw" target="_blank">Mean Value Theorem</a>: It has a slider that allows us to explore at which point on the curve the tangent line is parallel to the secant line.
- <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jdszbgj9f4" target="_blank">Net Area</a>: This shows the net area for a definite integral of a function that is not nonnegative on the interval of integration.
- <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kyhgxs0ot5" target="_blank">Log as an Integral</a>: The area under the curve $$y = \frac{1}{x}$$ from $$1$$ to $$b$$ for some $$b \geq 1$$ gives the value of natural log of $$b$$.
- <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kns84jl4cv" target="_blank">Improper Integrals ofÂ 1/xÂ andÂ 1/x^2</a>: This compares the area under the curves $$y = \frac{1}{x}$$ and $$y = \frac{1}{x^2}$$ from $$x = 1$$ to $$x = b$$ for some $$b \geq 1$$.
