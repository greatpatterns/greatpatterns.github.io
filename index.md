- <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sh43kd1ytb" target="_blank">Squeeze Theorem</a>: This shows how $$f(x) = x^2\cos\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$$ is trapped between the two curves $$y = x^2$$ and $$y = -x^2$$ near $$x = 0$$.
- <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/w89j6rob2z" target="_blank">Infinite Limits of 1/x</a>: This shows the behavior of the reciprocal function $$y = \frac{1}{x}$$ near $$0$$.
- <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yqszno4ff1" target="_blank">Secant Lines and Tangent Line</a>: This shows how the secant lines approach the tangent line at a given point on the function $$y = \cos x$$.
- <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kns84jl4cv" target="_blank">Improper Integrals ofÂ 1/xÂ andÂ 1/x^2</a>: This compares the area under the curves $$y = \frac{1}{x}$$ and $$y = \frac{1}{x^2}$$ from $$x = 1$$ to $$x = b$$ for some $$b \geq 1$$.
